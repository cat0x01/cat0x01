## Hi 👋, I’m cat0x01

Breaking systems to understand how to secure them.  
Focused on **Offensive Security** and the **Red Team journey**.

## 🔴 About Me
I’m a cybersecurity practitioner with a strong hands-on background in **offensive security**, built through labs, CTFs, real-world simulations, and continuous self-study.

I use **Linux as my primary operating system**, work daily with security tools and scripts, and actively practice attacker methodologies across web, network, and system layers.

My long-term goal is to operate as a **professional Red Team operator**, simulating real-world adversaries to help organizations improve their security posture.
